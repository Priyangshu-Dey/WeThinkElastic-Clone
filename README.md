# WeThinkElastic-Clone
In this project i have tried to clone a website from awwwards.com.
This project has been made with HTML, Vanila CSS, and GSAP.js . This website has come cool industry level animations powered by GSAP. I made this website after learning GSAP.js which is a pretty cool JavaScript library ! It is really one of the coolest JS library i have come across so far...really makes the job easy :)
